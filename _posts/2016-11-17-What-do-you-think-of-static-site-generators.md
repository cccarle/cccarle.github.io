     <p> Static generator can be good in different contexts. 
     A blog or a presentation of yourself is a perfect context.
      A smaller site with less complex things. I do think itÂ´s a nice way to work with,For example it is nice not having to make a template for all pages. And then be able to make edits to the base file.
      But i do feel like the pages loading screen takes a bit too long to load, but that's probably something else.</p>
