     <p>I think it's convenient and a good tool to reduce the number of lines of code, and avoid repeating yourself. It simply improving the structure of the code.
      However, I have only used the foundation we got to work with and then added the adjustments in the templets instead. 
      I believe that I would have used me more of it if I had started to create from scratch.</p>
