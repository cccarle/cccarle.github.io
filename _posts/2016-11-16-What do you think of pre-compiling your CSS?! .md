     <p>I think it's convenient and a good tool to reduce the number of lines of code, and avoid repeating yourself. It simply improving the structure of the code. 
      However, I have only used the foundation we got to work with and then added the adjustments in the templets instead. 
      I believe that I would have used me more of it if I had started to create from scratch. I hope to learn more about markdown, itÂ´ seems like a smart way to write "html". 
      
The only downside I can think of is that when you are debugging the code it becomes more difficult because the line numbers in browser do not match the source. For an exampwl when you mix multiple files.</p>
