##Hey!
My name is Carl Ejnarsson. I'm 23 years old and currently studying programming at LNU.

Currently living in Kalmar, Sweden. But is actually from a small town called Oskarshamn.


I hope to soon be able to master all the programming languages. Or maybe not all. But some anyway.


Here's a picture of me !
